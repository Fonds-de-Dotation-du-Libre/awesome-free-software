Being a developer friendly tool, that integrates well with other development tools used at KLM, Gatling was quickly adopted by developers in the product teams. By integrating performance tests in the delivery pipeline, the teams get daily feedback on performance during a sprint, so that they can detect and solve issues early in the development process.",
