The particular circumstances and the job specifications will determine which solution is more advantageous. That also applies to vulnerability management solutions designed to detect weak points in a network. One of the reasons he turned to the GSM 500 Greenbone Security Manager was because the company supports the development of open-source variants.",

Recognizing a problem quickly, though, is not enough for him. Together with Greenbone, he initiated a solution for the university that integrates the Greenbone Security Manager with Nagios/Centreon monitoring software. The solution furnishes administrators all the data they need on an uncluttered dashboard without delay so that they can react quickly whenever necessary.",
