The Global Quality departments of pharmaceutical industries assess the competences of their employees through a certified protocol so as to provide the Food and Drug Administration with the evidence of skills in the form of Individual Training Files. Salesforces in banks and industry are invited to play with serious games that simulate the client objections and the salesperson capacity to address them.

L’objectif était de ré-informatiser la « Bibliothèque centrale » et la « Bibliothèque musicale ». Le projet a débuté par la migration et la fusion des 2 bases existantes LORIS vers une base PMB unique. La volonté de Radio France était de profiter de cette ré-informatisation pour passer au modèle relationnel de données FRBR pour leur catalogue. Des ateliers de modélisation ont été organisés pour définir les schémas de données à implémenter. C’est à partir de ces ateliers de spécifications que le logiciel PMB a été enrichi de toutes les fonctionnalités liées au catalogage FRBR et que les données de Radio France ont été traitées pour créer les liens entre les différentes entités du modèle. PMB Services a aussi développé, dans PMB, toute la gestion spécifique des partitions musicales en intégrant un module de gestion des nomenclatures. Le portail constitue le dernier élément clé du projet et permet aux usagers de faire des recherches dans les fonds, de naviguer dans les références par rebonds directement en lien avec la modélisation de données qui a été faite. Des « vues » ont été mises en œuvre dans le portail pour permettre des recherches spécifiques dans la « bibliothèque principale » ou dans la « bibliothèque musicale ». Des développements complémentaires sont en cours actuellement avec Radio France pour rendre encore plus simple et ergonomique le catalogage FRBR.","image":"https://www.sigb.net/img_cache/4893f864bde3e36efa76b0a42c1912e3.png","industry":"Media","customer":"Radio France","country":"fr","language":"fr","url":"https://www.sigb.net/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=860"},{"title":"Fusion de 7 bases PMB pour créer une base documentaire unique pour le réseau international d'écoles","description":"","image":"https://www.sigb.net/img_cache/73b4f2d7567cb22ff98c4f6872d01ac4.png","industry":"Education","customer":"SEK International Schools Barcelone","country":"es","language":"fr","url":"https://www.sigb.net/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=1114"},{"title":"Mise en oeuvre d'un portail contributif","description":"Mise en oeuvre d'un portail contributif autour de la convention de New York de 1958.
